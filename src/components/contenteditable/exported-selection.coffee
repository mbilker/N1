  ### Public: Tests for equality amongst exported selections

  When we restore the selection later, we need to find a node that looks
  the same as the one we saved (since they're different object
  references).

  Unfortunately there many be many nodes that "look" the same (match the
  `isEqualNode`) test. For example, say I have a bunch of lines with the
  TEXT_NODE "Foo". All of those will match `isEqualNode`. To fix this we
  assume there will be multiple matches and keep track of the index of the
  match. e.g. all "Foo" TEXT_NODEs may look alike, but I know I want the
  Nth "Foo" TEXT_NODE. We store this information in the `startNodeIndex`
  and `endNodeIndex` fields via the `DOMUtils.getNodeIndex` method.
