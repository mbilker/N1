/**
 * If a plugin:
 *
 * 1. Operates on a draft
 * 2. Has a backend component that needs to remotely access the sent
 *    message of the draft
 * 3. Inserts a reference to the draft on send
 *
 * The issue arises when you need to reference a message before it's sent.
 * For example, suppose you want to insert a link in the draft of the
 * form:
 *
 * https://mycustombackend.com/track/<message_id>
 *
 * That link needs to be inserted before the draft is sent. Since the
 * draft hasn't yet been sent, we don't have the message_id of the sent
 * message.
 *
 * You may ask, why don't we just save the draft to get a "server id" for
 * the draft? There are 2 current (March 2016) major problems with that:
 *
 * 1. Saved draft IDs aren't consistent. A draft's server ID is not
 * guaranteed to be it's messageID once it's sent. Drafts may be deleted
 * once a message is sent, or they may update over time.
 *
 * 2. Drafts are frequently sent without ever being saved. We will
 * send drafts by just POSTing the raw body and participants to the /send
 * endpoint of the API. We may never get any sort of server ID until
 * after the message has been sent.
 *
 * To fix this problem we instead use the draftClientId in our urls and
 * then after send, tell our backend what draftClientId maps to what
 * messageId.
 *
 * Now, when we insert a link into a draft, it's of the form:
 *
 * https://mycustombackend.com/track/<draftClientId>
 *
 * Then, by listening to for `Actions.sendDraftSuccess`, we queue this
 * task
 *
 * The task will POST to your backend url the draftClientId and the
 * coresponding messageId
