# Public: ActionBridge
#
# The ActionBridge has two responsibilities:
# 1. When you're in a secondary window, the ActionBridge observes all Root actions. When a
#    Root action is fired, it converts it's payload to JSON, tunnels it to the main window
#    via IPC, and re-fires the Action in the main window. This means that calls to actions
#    like Actions.queueTask(task) can be fired in secondary windows and consumed by the
#    TaskQueue, which only lives in the main window.

# 2. The ActionBridge listens to the DatabaseStore and re-broadcasts it's trigger() event
#    into all of the windows of the application. This is important, because the DatabaseStore
#    in all secondary windows is a read-replica. Only the DatabaseStore in the main window
#    of the application consumes persistModel actions and writes changes to the database.
