Public: Collection attributes provide basic support for one-to-many relationships.
For example, Threads in N1 have a collection of Labels or Folders.

When Collection attributes are marked as `queryable`, the DatabaseStore
automatically creates a join table and maintains it as you create, save,
and delete models. When you call `persistModel`, entries are added to the
join table associating the ID of the model with the IDs of models in the collection.

Collection attributes have an additional clause builder, `contains`:

```coffee
DatabaseStore.findAll(Thread).where([Thread.attributes.categories.contains('inbox')])
```

This is equivalent to writing the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT `Thread`.`data` FROM `Thread`
INNER JOIN `ThreadLabel` AS `M1` ON `M1`.`id` = `Thread`.`id`
WHERE `M1`.`value` = 'inbox'
ORDER BY `Thread`.`last_message_received_timestamp` DESC
```

The value of this attribute is always an array of other model objects.
