This is a **fork** of the main [N1 project](https://github.com/nylas/N1).

**N1 is an open-source mail client built on the modern web with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/).** It is designed to be extensible, so it's easy to create new experiences and workflows around email. N1 is built on the Nylas Sync Engine which is also [open source free software](https://github.com/nylas/sync-engine).

# Download N1

You can download compiled versions of N1 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (.deb) from [https://nylas.com/N1](https://nylas.com/N1). You can also build and run N1 on Fedora. A Fedora distribution is coming soon!

# Build A Plugin

Plugins lie at the heart of N1 and give it its powerful features. Building your own plugins allows you to integrate the app with other tools, experiment with new workflows, and more. Follow the [Getting Started guide](http://nylas.com/N1/getting-started/) to write your first plugin in 5 minutes.

If you would like to run the N1 source and contribute, check out our [contributing
guide](https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Running Locally
By default the N1 source points to our hosted version of the Nylas Sync Engine; however, the Sync Engine is open source and you can [run it yourself](https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-against-open-source-sync-engine).

# Feature Requests / Package Ideas
