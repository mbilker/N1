# QuickSchedule

Say goodbye to the hassle of scheduling! This new plugin lets you avoid the typical back-and-forth of picking a time to meet. Just select a few options, and your recipient confirms with one click. It's the best way to instantly schedule meetings.

This plugin works by adding a small "QuickSchedule" button next to the Send button in the composer. Clicking the button will open a calendar where you can select potential times to meet. These times are placed in the draft, and your recipient can confirm a time with one click. It even automatically adds the event to both calendars!

#### Who is this for?

Anyone who makes a lot of appointments! If you are a developer, this is also a great example of a more complicated plugin that requires a backend service, and demonstrates how arbitrary JavaScript can be inserted to create custom functionality.
