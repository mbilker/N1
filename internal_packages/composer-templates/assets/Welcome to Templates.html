  Hi there <code class="var empty">First Name</code>,
</p>
<p>
  Welcome to the templates package! Templates live in the <strong>~/.nylas/templates</strong>
  directory on your computer. Each template is an HTML file - the name of the
  file is the name of the template, and it's contents are the default message body.
</p>
<p>
  If you include HTML &lt;code&gt; tags in your template, you can create
  regions that you can jump between and fill easily. Check out the source of
  the template for a <code class="var">super awesome</code> example!
</p>
<p>
  Give &lt;code&gt; tags the `var` class to mark them as template regions. Add
  the `empty` class to make them dark yellow. When you send your message, &lt;code&gt;
  tags are always stripped so the recipient never sees any highlighting.
