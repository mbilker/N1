# View on GitHub

The "View on GitHub" plugin adds a button to the toolbar above the message view.
When you view a message from GitHub that contains a "View on GitHub" link,
the button appears and makes it easy to jump to the issue / pull request / comment
on GitHub.

This example is a good starting point for plugins that want to create custom
actions.
