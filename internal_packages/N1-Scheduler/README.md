# QuickSchedule

Say goodbye to the hassle of scheduling! This new plugin lets you avoid
the typical back-and-forth of picking a time to meet. Just select a few
options, and your recipient confirms with one click. It's the best way to
instantly schedule meetings.

This plugin works by adding a small "Schedule" button next to the Send
button in the composer. Clicking the button will prompt the creation of a
quick event creator.

You can even select a set of proposed times. When you do this a calendar
pops up with your availability. You can then select some proposed times
for the receipient to choose from.

#### Enable this plugin

1. Download and run N1

2. Navigate to Preferences > Plugins and click "Enable" beside the plugin.

#### Who is this for?

Anyone who makes a lot of appointments! If you are a developer, this is
also a great example of a more complicated plugin that requires a backend
service, and demonstrates how arbitrary JavaScript can be inserted to
create custom functionality.
