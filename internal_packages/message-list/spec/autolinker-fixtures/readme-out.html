1. Once you feel familiar with the endpoints and http responses go ham!!!

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the axefax api (which you are encouraged to do) here are the basics.

- Ruby version: 2.2.2
- System dependencies: Rails, AWS, postgres, eb-cli
- Configuration:
```bash
$ git clone <a href="https://github.com/a/b.git" title="https://github.com/a/b.git">https://github.com/a/b.git</a>
$ bundle install
```
- Database intitialization/creation:
```bash
$ rake db:reset db:setup db:seed
```
- How to run the test suite:
```bash
$ rspec spec
```
- or alternatively:
```bash
$ guard
```
- run the server:
```bash
$ rails server
```
- Git Guidelines:
 - Please create a contributor/feature branch for any changes you make.
 - Be sure to always pull down the latest master branch before pushing.
 - etc...
- Generating Documentation:
 - This app makes use of the (Apipie Gem)[<a href="https://github.com/Apipie/apipie-rails" title="https://github.com/Apipie/apipie-rails">https://github.com/Apipie/apipie-rails</a>]
 - To Auto/Re-Generate Documentation for API Endpoints based on config/<a href="routes.rb" title="routes.rb">routes.rb</a>
   and the spec suite run...
```bash
$ APIPIE_RECORD=params rake spec:controllers
$ APIPIE_RECORD=examples rake spec:controllers
```
 - Then to generate static HTML files for production...
```bash
$ rake apipie:static
```
- Deployment instructions:
 - If the test suite is passing and you've successfully merged to master and pushed up to github...
```bash
$ eb deploy
```
 - Hopefully you won't need to ssh into the remote server to run migrations but if you do...
```bash
$ eb ssh
remote:ec2 ~ $ cd /var/app/current/
```
 - From here you have access to a limited set of railsy stuffs. But for example rake db:migrate
